## Introduction

MilliwaysR is the R interface for Milliways: the interactive multiverse analysis visualisation tool

### Installation

- Install the R library: `devtools::install()`
- On installation of the R library in a machine, the files in the `inst/` directory will be saved 
- `milliways` provides functions such as `milliways_install()`, `start()` etc. to initialise the visualisation

## Example usage

First, you will need to install Milliways in your system. You can do so by calling the function: `milliways_install()`

To open Milliways with the results of a multiverse analysis, you can use the `start()` function. This function requires four arguments:

- `results`: (path to) a JSON file which contains the estimates from each universe in the multiverse analysis.
- `code`: (path to) a JSON file which contains the code used to generate the multiverse object.
- `data`: (path to) a JSON file which contains the dataset used in the multiverse analysis.
- `analysis`: (path to) the Explorable Multiverse Analysis Report (EMAR) HTML file

We provide samples of this in the directory `dist`. For example, to initialise Milliways with the multiverse analysis of the hurricane dataset, you can call the following command:

```
start(
    "dist/hurricane/hurricane-data.json",
    "dist/hurricane/hurricane-code.json",
    "dist/hurricane/hurricane.json",
    "dist/hurricane/analysis.html"
)
```


## Development

If you are interested in supporting the development of the visualisation tool:

- The visualisation tool is built using Svelte.js with Rollup  
- The files used in the development of the visualisation library can be found in `inst/milliways/` directory
- In the `inst/milliways/`, please do not use `npm` to install all the node modules and run the visualisation tool in the dev mode
- To update the visualisation tool, install and make changes to the visualisation in a separate directory
- I will then pull the updates into this project
